# Scratch Basket ball pong
A simple game made in scratch where a basketball keeps bouncing on edge contact and keeps continuing until it crosses the bottom line.
A paddle is used to control the bounce of the ball and keep it bouncing.
The score of the game is counted and restarts on game restart.
It's really simple but really addictive too ðŸ˜‚
