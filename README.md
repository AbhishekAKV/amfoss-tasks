## My View about the tasks
The tasks were exciting and enjoyable to complete. I approached each task as a problem to be overcome, learning as I went along and honing my talents. Since technology is an area that is continually expanding, I am certain that I will find this experience useful at some point.
They were so incredible that I am at a loss for words to adequately explain them. The finest aspect of it is that thisÂ challenge us to learn more. The challenges are intended to develop the habit of self-learning, and in my experience, they have been beneficial.
