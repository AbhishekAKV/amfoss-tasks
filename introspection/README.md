# Introspection
### Why must we choose?
I studied Python for my 11th and 12th grades, and ever since, I've been interested in programming. I began to research all the opportunities and career paths in this industry, and by the time I got there, I was completely convinced on the technology-related companies I could start up. I also love trying out new software and learning about it. I particularly enjoy checking out different apps and trying to figure out how they were created and how I might be able to improve them. My background in electronics provides me a taste of both the hardware and software realms, and I feel like I would like working in both and more towards theÂ Software domain and fullfil my dream of making my own Start-up one day.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I'm particularly fascinated by the tasks involving Flutter and web development. I have a strong interest in both of these fields because I love art and design, therefore I think I could definitely benefit from them. I also have a strong desire to learn more about programming, therefore if I get the opportunity to join AMFOSS, I would aim to maximize my time and learn more about the aforementioned topics at a rapid and steady rate that I would not be able to achieve otherwise. In order to avoid disappointing anyone and to ensure that I am continually learning, I would also like to place huge focus on the academic side of things.

### How would you ccontribute back to the club?
I want to devote as much time and energy as I can to the tasks and responsibilities assigned to me, and I want to make sure that I can produce something that the team at AMFOSS would be proud of.

### Do you have any feedback on the selection process?
One of the most unique and distinctive selection processes I've ever experienced is this selection process. The tasks appear to be quite difficult while simultaneously being incredibly fascinating in order to bring out the group's true potential and force us to think creatively. The tasks have taught me how to use Google effectively. I can't remark on improvements because I've never gone through a selection procedure like this one. The process was absolutely moral and excellently upheld its standards.
