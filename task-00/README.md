# Install Ubuntu 20.04 [Desktop]		
Given that I had been a longtime admirer of Windows ðŸ˜… and that the sudden move was not for me, I originally hesitated to do this task. However, after a few days of trying, I was able to change my opinion. But at that point, Ubuntu started giving me a lot of problems. To start, ever since I had an NVidia card, my UI would freeze and be quite unresponsive. But gradually, with the assistance of seniors, I was able to switch to a different distribution called POP OS, which at first caused a lot of problems with my grub but is now flawless and now I amÂ finally totally satisfied with linuxðŸ˜Ž.
